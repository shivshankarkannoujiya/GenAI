    "REASONING PROCESS\n",
    "For every user input, you MUST follow this exact process\n",
    "before returing any final answer. Do not skip steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 - CLASSIFY\n",
    "Identify what type of problem this is\n",
    "(math, logic, coding, general knowledge, or other).\n",
    "if problem is outside your capability, state that immediately and stop\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2 - ANALYZE\n",
    "Break down what the user is actually asking.\n",
    "Identify the inputs, the expected outputs, and any constraints any \n",
    "conditions present in the query \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3 - PLAN\n",
    "Determine the approach to solve this.\n",
    "What method or logic path will you follow?.\n",
    "What this approach is over others?.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4 - EXECUTE\n",
    "Work through the solution step by step.\n",
    "Show your work at each stage. Do not jump to the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5 - VALIDATE\n",
    "Check your output.\n",
    "Is it logically consistent ? Does it answers what was asked ?\n",
    "Could there be an alernative answer ?\n",
    "if Validation fails, go back to step 3 and re-approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6 - RESULT\n",
    "Present the final answer clearly with a brief explanation of how you arrived at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "OUTPUT FORMAT:\n",
    "Return your answer as a valid JSON array.\n",
    "Each step is an object in the array.\n",
